An [older article I did on Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN)](/articles/2007/07/20/everything-old-is-new-again-wiswesser-line-notation-wln) seems to have interested a few people over the years. For the unfamiliar, WLN was a [line notation system](/articles/2007/03/14/eleven-qualities-of-the-perfect-line-notation-for-the-web) that at one point was *the* way to name organic compounds. Among its most remarkable attributes was how easy it was to learn - supporters claimed that high school graduates with minimal chemistry knowledge could be taught WLN in a matter of days. WLN was used both as a unique identifier (exactly the role InChI plays today), and as a display mechanism before the advent of [chemical graphics systems](/articles/2006/11/02/stone-knives-and-bear-skins).

Now it turns out that WLN is popping up in a most modern place: [PubChem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

As part of a structure/synonym interconversion service [Metamolecular](http://metamolecular.com) has started offering to its customers, we've been analyzing the mountain of synonyms contained in PubChem. One of the things we found: a number of WLNs.

For example, the PubChem record for [Fluoral hydrate](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?sid=76852) gives the WLNs "QYQXFFF" (connected structure) and "VHXFFF &QH" (disconnected hydrate) as synonyms.

Many of these WLN synonyms have been deposited as part of the [DTP/NCI Dataset](http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/). It's not clear at this point to what extent WLNs are still being generated and deposited into PubChem. I have it on good authority that no modern implementations of a WLN encoder exists, so these PubChem WLNs may simply be relics of a bygone era. Then again, maybe not.
