During a recent talk at the Spring 2010 American Chemical Society Meeting, I spoke about [Chempedia](http://chempedia.com) and [Chempedia Lab](http://lab.chempedia.com), and what makes them unique among chemical information systems. One aspect that seemed to get a lot of interest was the idea that the successful scientific information systems of the future would be designed around compelling [game mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics).

Game what?

Game mechanics are the underlying systems that drive games. This has nothing to do with audiovisual effects, explosions, or dice - but instead refers to those features of a system that make it seem more like a game and less like work.

Game mechanics have been around for thousands of years, and they're an essential part of holding societies together.

Everyone who has published (or read) a scientific paper has participated in one of the most productive game mechanics the world has ever created - the scientific publication system.

If you decide to watch the [Mixergy](http://mixergy.com) interview with [Amy Jo Kim](http://socialarchitect.typepad.com/musings/) (above), keep these features of the scientific publication system in mind:

-  [Impact Factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor)
-  [H-Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index)
-  Publication Count
-  Citation Count
-  Editorial Board Membership
-  Funding Agencies
-  Hiring and Tenure Committees

Useful as they have been, the game mechanics embedded within traditional scientific publication are now starting to [do more harm than good](/articles/2007/07/27/the-journal-deadpool-failing-business-models-and-sick-markets-in-scientific-publishing). Fortunately, we can do something about this by creating information systems that satisfy the need for game mechanics in science, while promoting the free flow of information - at price that reflects the astonishing advances in information technology over the last 10 years.

To my knowledge, [Chempedia](http://chempedia.com) and [Chempedia Lab](http://lab.chempedia.com) are the only chemical information systems to deliberately and extensively make use of game mechanics. But we hold no monopoly on this idea - there is virtually no end to what can be done with this simple concept.
