[Whyday](http://whyday.org), a day set aside to celebrate one of the Ruby community's [most prolific and innovative members](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff), is almost here.

You know that thing you've always wanted to build? The one that doesn't scale, has no path to 'monetization' whatsoever, and would make you look like a fool if you showed it to most of your peers?

Yes, that thing. Why not set aside one day this year and actually build it?
