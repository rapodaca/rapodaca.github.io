Is it just me or are others having problems resolving Wiley DOIs?

For example, [this one](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3011.1978.tb02896.x) ([direct](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121499820/abstract)) worked and then a few minutes later started giving the error:

> Error - DOI Not Found

I've seen this with other Wiley DOIs as well during the course of [an ongoing project](http://depth-first.com/articles/2010/04/08/wanted-a-few-good-chemists). The problem occurs and then some time later appears to go away. Any ideas as to what's up?
