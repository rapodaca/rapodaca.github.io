> The idea of gas engines was by no means new, but this was the first time that a really serious effort had been made to put them on the market.

All the wise people demonstrated conclusively that the engine could not compete with steam. They never thought that it might carve out a career for itself. That is the way with wise people - they are so wise and practical that they always know to a dot just why something cannot be done; they always know the limitations.
