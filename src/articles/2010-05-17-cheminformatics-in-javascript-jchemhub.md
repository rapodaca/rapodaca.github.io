Longtime readers of this blog know that I think [JavaScript for Cheminformatics](http://depth-first.com/articles/2008/07/15/javascript-for-cheminformatics) is an idea with a lot of potential. Recently, I ran across [JChemHub](http://github.com/chemhack/jchemhub), an open source toolkit for developing client-side cheminformatics applications.

JChemHub is written from scratch in JavaScript using the [Google Closure](http://code.google.com/closure/) library. Although documentation on the project is sparse, I was able to get started by following the instructions in the README file.

One tip: the sample HTML files are contained within the `jchemhub/views` directory. For example, to run the reaction display demo, open the file `jchemhub/view/demo.html`.

As I've said before, there's [a big difference](http://depth-first.com/articles/2007/06/29/starting-quitting-and-finishing) between building cheminformatics tools and building something as complicated as a working structure editor for Web applications. Still, JChemHub is worth checking out; it won't solve your structure editor or display problems today, but tools like it may solve them in the future.
