At [Metamolecular](http://metamolecular.com), we're hard at work developing a new Web-based chemical information service. There's just one problem - we need twelve people knowledgeable in at least one branch of the chemical literature to test it.

I won't let the cat out of the bag here, other than to say that we're cooking up a free ([as in freedom](http://creativecommons.org/)) system to address three difficult problems in chemistry:

1.  It's almost impossible to keep up with the chemical literature these days given the sheer volume of published works.
2.  Electronic journals make it difficult to 'accidentally' find cool new papers.
3.  Traditional peer review has limitations.

If you're interested in kicking the tires of a shiny new community-driven approach to keeping current with and reviewing the chemical literature and you'd like to participate in the test, I'd like to <a href="http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01psyC-58J3XSX6pLP7siKuA==&amp;c=v4w5XYnPQNsV7XRSS2f3x8h5VvjLbpYZHcQVdfhP13g=" onclick="window.open('http://mailhide.recaptcha.net/d?k=01psyC-58J3XSX6pLP7siKuA==&amp;c=v4w5XYnPQNsV7XRSS2f3x8h5VvjLbpYZHcQVdfhP13g=', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">hear from you</a>.
